# Testing gitHub markdown

## Emphasis

*italics* with asterisks* or _italics_ with underscores_

**bold** with two *asterisks

**_combined_** with both

## Lists

1. Ordered list item
2. Another item in the list  
  * Unordered sub list needs two spaces and an asterisk
3. Create indented paragraph this time, please!
 
   indented paragraph needs three spaces in front

   to have line break without paragraph add two trailing spaces  
   does it work?

## Links

[Inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's homepage")

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

inline `code` has back-ticks ` around it

blocks of code should be wrapped with three back-ticks,
for example:
```
let s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
```

## Blockquotes
>Blockquotes look like description text or a quote  
>they are created with right pointing arrow

## Horizontal Lines
three or more hyphens (-) or underscores (_)

---

## Other stuff
include tables, footnotes, images -> don't need this stuff I guess
